> Discover brilliant, underrated films — personalized just for you.

## 📘 Project Summary

**MoviesYouDidntWatch.com** is a smart, AI-powered movie discovery platform built for people who are tired of seeing the same recycled recommendations.

Unlike TMDB, IMDb, or Netflix, this app focuses on **highly-rated**, **well-voted**, but **overlooked gems** — and avoids recommending what you've already seen or rejected.

Users can explore through:
- A powerful **natural language chatbot**
- Manual filters for full control
- A clean, responsive movie grid
- Personal lists: ✅ Seen, ⏱ Watch Later, ❌ Not Interested

## 🌟 Key Highlights

| Problem | Our Solution |
|--------|--------------|
| Same movies everywhere | Prioritize *hidden gems* with great reviews |
| No personalization | Tracks Seen / Not Interested / Watch Later |
| Poor genre matching | Only shows strict genre matches (1st or 2nd position) |
| Limited control | Manual filters + smart chatbot combo |
| Language issues | Dual-language UI (🇬🇧 English / 🇫🇷 French) |
| Sites don't listen | Ours understands _natural language_ |
| Overwhelming choices | Curated list with quality-based filtering |

---

## 👥 Target Audience

- Movie lovers frustrated by mainstream platforms
- Cinephiles searching for quality over hype
- People who want a **chat-first** experience with smart suggestions
- Bilingual (French/English) users looking for localized results

---

## 🧠 Why This Project Matters

### Traditional movie apps fail to:

- Remember your preferences
- Let you *talk* to them
- Filter results properly
- Show anything but the latest trend

### We fix that by:

✅ Combining AI + Filters  
✅ Enforcing quality (IMDb + votes)  
✅ Never repeating content  
✅ Supporting multilingual UX  
✅ Making exploration feel like a conversation
